1.The class used to implement the controller pattern in the snapping_sheet library is the SnappingSheetController class. It allows the developer to modify the rate and position of the snapping as well as to stop snapping altogether. It also reveals information regarding the widget to the developer such as its current position, current snapping position and whether or not the widget is currently snapping.

2.The SnappingPosition class recieves a snappingCurve argument which decides the animation the sheet uses when snapping into a position.

3.GestureDetector provides more gesture control such as dragging, while Inkwell primarily supports simple taps. On the other hand Inkwell is able to provide a ripple effect when its child is tapped.
